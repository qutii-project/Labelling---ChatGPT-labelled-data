# Labelling---ChatGPT-labelled-data

The project aims to create an optimal model for automatically categorizing questions and answers, employing a large dataset of pre-labeled data. Initially, manually prelabelled data was used. Later on, the data was pre labelled using ChatGPT. The system employs a high-level architecture, utilizing comprehensive data preprocessing and an ensemble machine learning approach. System requirements encompass essential Python libraries and dependencies, covering CSV handling, text processing, feature extraction, machine learning frameworks, and visualization, with diverse techniques contributing to improved accuracy and thorough evaluation metrics providing insights into system characteristics. Around 78 percent accuracy was obtained using data from manually pre labelled model. The accuracy is lower for the ChatGPT labelled data.
